# My own custom [AIDA64](https://www.aida64.com/products/aida64-extreme?language_content_entity=en) SensorPanel!

That's is my personal sensor panel! With all the values that are important in my eyes, presented in a compact and clean way

It has a resolution of ```2560 x 720``` and therefore fits perfectly on the [Corsair Xeneon Edge](https://www.corsair.com/de/de/explorer/gamer/monitors/corsair-xeneon-edge/?srsltid=AfmBOor2jlZt06g87vyhdLfUl6yCoW-XWeo7dL-RFKcHGhcWN3YRWKt8) display!

The configuration is very clearly laid out, making it relatively easy to find your way around and change values if necessary.
