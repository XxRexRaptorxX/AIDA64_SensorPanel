# My own custom AIDA64 SensorPanel!

-----

That's is my personal sensor panel! 

It has a resolution of 2560 x 720 and therefore fits perfectly on the [Corsair Xeneon Edge](https://www.corsair.com/de/de/explorer/gamer/monitors/corsair-xeneon-edge/?srsltid=AfmBOor2jlZt06g87vyhdLfUl6yCoW-XWeo7dL-RFKcHGhcWN3YRWKt8) display!
